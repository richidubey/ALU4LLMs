Despite significant advancements, Large Language
Models (LLMs) still exhibit limitations in their
arithmetic capabilities. These models, while adept
at generalizing to various tasks like document ex-
traction and QA, often struggle with performing
accurate mathematical calculations, especially be-
yond basic arithmetic. This deficiency arises due
to the inherent nature of LLMs, which are trained
primarily on textual data, rather than on specialized
mathematical problems or algorithms. As a result,
their mathematical reasoning is often error-prone,
limiting their utility in tasks that require precise
numerical computations.

LLMs to compute solutions to arithmetic problems efficiently and correctly.
